            <p>I am a Software Engineer based in the Greater Sacramento Area. I graduated with a Computer Science
              Degree from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2018. Since then, I have been honing my skills through my various experiences 
              from starting as a Software Support Engineer for SCADA/HMI Software and into growing into a Software Engineer role. I am enthusiastic 
              about continuing to learn and grow into more specialized skills as my career advances.
